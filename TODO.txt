Here are the major TODO items:


  * In addition to human readable output, write CSV to a log
  * Do big runs and look at performance variance in a statistically
    rigorous way.

  * Include the Intel AES sample library!

  * Use template haskell or quasiquoting to check whether to use AESNI
    at INSTALL TIME not at runtime.
