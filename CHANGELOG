[2011.01.28] {unexpected performance bump}

Note: when I duplicated part of the Crypto I also saw a little
performance bump on my 3.33 ghz nehalem desktop IN SPITE of the fact
that I had tweaked and reinstalled my system's Crypto library, taking
care to compile it with -O2.  Better inlining?

Old numbers, per second:

         15,753 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 209,832 cycles/int
         31,577 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 104,680 cycles/int

New numbers:

         16,052 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 205,226 cycles/int
         32,411 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 101,641 cycles/int



[2011.01.29] {First results}

This is what I'm getting (3.33 ghz nehalem) on a single thread compiled without -threaded:

    How many random numbers can we generate in a second on one thread?
      Cost of rdtsc (ffi call):    83
      Approx getCPUTime calls per second: 205,640
      Approx clock frequency:  3,306,891,339

	114,675,116 random ints generated [rand/store Haskell]        ~ 28.84 cycles/int

And with -threaded but a single thread (no -N argument):

    How many random numbers can we generate in a second on one thread?
      Cost of rdtsc (ffi call):    83
      Approx getCPUTime calls per second: 226,961
      Approx clock frequency:  3,306,672,915

	     15,314 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 215,925 cycles/int
	     31,241 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 105,844 cycles/int

	 62,688,727 random ints generated [rand/store Haskell]        ~ 52.75 cycles/int
    Finished.

Wow... the foreign versions take a big hit from -threaded.

Ack, perhaps worse, with -N4 but only a single threaded *workload* we run into problems:

    How many random numbers can we generate in a second on one thread?
      Cost of rdtsc (ffi call):    317
      Approx getCPUTime calls per second: 154,859
      Approx clock frequency:  2,797,993,233
      First, timing with System.Random interface:
	 12,774,233 random ints generated [constant zero gen]         ~ 219 cycles/int
	  8,211,430 random ints generated [System.Random stdGen]      ~ 341 cycles/int
	      4,990 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 560,720 cycles/int
	     18,429 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 151,826 cycles/int
      Comparison to C's rand():
	540,942,561 random ints generated [ptr store in C loop]       ~ 5.17 cycles/int
	 56,722,299 random ints generated [rand/store in C loop]      ~ 49.33 cycles/int
	 63,173,134 random ints generated [rand / Haskell loop]       ~ 44.29 cycles/int
	 61,999,404 random ints generated [rand/store Haskell]        ~ 45.13 cycles/int

It doesn't measure the clock frequency accurately in this mode!
I can't understand why that would be... but thread migration may be the culprit.
Yet -qm and -qa don't fix the problem at all...

Apparently -N4 also suffers from HIGH VARIANCE in throughput (which is
independent of the cpu frequency measurement... though it does mean
that the cycles/int numbers are bogus below).

     31,413,439 random ints generated [constant zero gen]         ~ 87.08 cycles/int
      8,999,510 random ints generated [System.Random stdGen]      ~ 304 cycles/int
         11,755 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 232,703 cycles/int
            367 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 7,453,473 cycles/int

     41,861,866 random ints generated [constant zero gen]         ~ 47.84 cycles/int
      8,073,351 random ints generated [System.Random stdGen]      ~ 248 cycles/int
         11,850 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 168,992 cycles/int
         19,853 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 100,869 cycles/int
 
     12,774,233 random ints generated [constant zero gen]         ~ 219 cycles/int
       8,211,430 random ints generated [System.Random stdGen]      ~ 341 cycles/int
	   4,990 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 560,720 cycles/int
	  18,429 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 151,826 cycles/int

Presumably some of this is because of attempted sparking gone awry?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MULTI-THREADED MEASUREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm starting to measure 4-thread performance (all threads generating
randoms), and I'm about to switch to looking at per-thread throughput,
but first here's aggregate throughput.  Kind of surprising, right?
The reference version is doing better all of a sudden.

	179,217,901 random ints generated [constant zero gen]         ~ 10.80 cycles/int
	 49,573,433 random ints generated [System.Random stdGen]      ~ 39.05 cycles/int
	     69,093 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 28,020 cycles/int
	     44,454 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 43,550 cycles/int
    Comparison to C's rand():
	  6,450,217 random ints generated [rand/store in C loop]      ~ 384 cycles/int
	  8,589,888 random ints generated [rand / Haskell loop]       ~ 289 cycles/int
	  4,038,556 random ints generated [rand/store Haskell]        ~ 614 cycles/int

And the foreign/rand version took a MASSIVE hit, which doesn't make
that much sense, especially for the first variant.  I forg

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 NOW SWITCHING TO MEAN PER-THREAD THROUGHPUT, NORMALIZED TO NUMTHREADS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These numbers are not looking bad for the pure haskell versions.
Pretty much keeping all four CPUs busy.  C's rand is not supposed to
be reentrant so it doesn't really matter.

Beware the incorrect clock frequency:

    How many random numbers can we generate in a second on one thread?
      Cost of rdtsc (ffi call):    228
      Approx getCPUTime calls per second: 134,849
      Approx clock frequency:  2,478,290,084

    Now 4 threads, reporting mean randoms-per-second-per-thread:
      First, timing with System.Random interface:
	 46,142,182 random ints generated [constant zero gen]         ~ 54.48 cycles/int
	  9,957,644 random ints generated [System.Random stdGen]      ~ 252 cycles/int
	     14,146 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 177,683 cycles/int
	     29,046 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 86,539 cycles/int
      Comparison to C's rand():
	441,296,179 random ints generated [ptr store in C loop]       ~ 5.70 cycles/int
	  1,488,240 random ints generated [rand/store in C loop]      ~ 1,689 cycles/int
	  1,443,434 random ints generated [rand / Haskell loop]       ~ 1,741 cycles/int
	  1,725,817 random ints generated [rand/store Haskell]        ~ 1,456 cycles/int

I don't know why the "reference" version seemed to be doing better
above... now it's back to its old pattern.

I'm still seeing a fair amount of variance even with the
all-threads-working workload.  For example, the same run as did 29K
BurtonGenSlow above, can also give me:

     47,082,714 random ints generated [constant zero gen]         ~ 58.68 cycles/int
     10,789,920 random ints generated [System.Random stdGen]      ~ 256 cycles/int
         11,917 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 231,843 cycles/int
         23,854 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 115,824 cycles/int

     15,289,001 random ints generated [constant zero gen]         ~ 162 cycles/int
       3,586,250 random ints generated [System.Random stdGen]      ~ 693 cycles/int
	   4,487 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow/reference]   ~ 553,683 cycles/int
	   8,994 random ints generated [BurtonGenSlow]             ~ 276,241 cycles/int

The variance doesn't seem to correlate with mutator PRODUCTIVITY.
Productivity is pretty good (92%) on the haskell-only part of the
benchmarks.

[2011.01.29] {Wrapping the Intel AES Sample Library}

The big question is whether to drop in their whole distribution and
call their build script, or try to rip out just the bits I need.

Here's the GCC call they use to build the intel_aes64.a library:

    for i in $asm; do echo do $i.s; $yasm -D__linux__ -g dwarf2 -f elf${sz} asm/x${arch}/$i.s -o obj/x${arch}/$i.o; done
    gcc -O3 -g -m${sz} -Iinclude/ -c src/intel_aes.c -o obj/x${arch}/intel_aes.o
    ar -r lib/x${arch}/intel_aes${arch}.a obj/x${arch}/*.o

Ok... I tried rebuilding the library by hand to get a .so

    gcc -fPIC -O3 -g -Iinclude/ -c src/intel_aes.c -o obj/x64/intel_aes.o
    gcc -shared -dynamic  -o lib/x64/libintel_aes64.so obj/x64/*.o




[2011.02.02] {Annoying link problems}

In commit 4bf79dfe55.. I reverted some recent refactorings to fix the weird link problem.

     Linking dist/build/benchmark-intel-aes-rng/benchmark-intel-aes-rng ...
     /home/newton/Dropbox/working_copies/intel-aes/dist/build/libHSintel-aes-0.1.1.a(GladmanAES.o): In function `s3iP_info':
     (.text+0x34c3): undefined reference to `__stginit_intelzmaeszm0zi1zi1_CodecziCryptoziConvertRNG_'
     collect2: ld returned 1 exit status


[2011.02.07] {Trying to build in windows, not having much luck}
.
I tried to get it to work with gcc 4.3.4, that failed for lack of intrin.h.

I tried to actually add the ../VC/bin directory to my path so I could
run cl.exe.  Then I tried the .bat file that came with the Intel
Sample library.  It seemed to get to the final "lib.exe" call at which
point it silently fails (errro code 127) with no message.


[2011.02.07] {Haddock problems}

I'm having a variety of different problems trying to build
documentation for this package.  If I do "runhaskell Setup.hs haddock"
I get the following:


     GHCi runtime linker: fatal error: I found a duplicate definition for symbol
	__hscore_S_IFDIR
     whilst processing object file
	/home/newton/.cabal/lib/directory-1.0.1.2/ghc-7.0.1/HSdirectory-1.0.1.2.o
     This could be caused by:
	* Loading two different object files which export the same symbol
	* Specifying the same object file twice on the GHCi command line
	* An incorrect `package.conf' entry, causing some object to be
	  loaded twice.
     GHCi cannot safely continue in this situation.  Exiting now.  Sorry.


If I try "cabal haddock" it fails silently with error code 127.

But if I run "haddock" by hand on the .hs files it seems to work ok.

At one point I thought I was dealing with this problem:
    http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/656

In particular I believe I ran into this error:
    cabal: Can't find transitive deps for haddock


[2011.02.07] {Ah, the error 127 business above was really a cabal problem}

I must be crashing cabal silently with my intel-aes.cabal file.
Nope.. that's not it dist/setup/setup lost it's execute bit (thanks
dropbox) and that completely flummoxed cabal.

The "cabal haddock" option above DOES result in the transitive deps error.
